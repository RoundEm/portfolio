                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Welcome! My name is Jason and I’m a web developer based in the greater-Seattle area. As difficult as it can sometimes be, I find a lot of satisfaction in programming due to the never-ending challenges it presents and how rewarding it is to overcome those challenges and help solve problems that make life more efficient and enjoyable.</p>

                <p>Before becoming a developer most of my work background was in account management and client relations. I've always enjoyed the chance to work in those fields and hone my people skills, but I often found myself working at the intersections where client service and technology meet and eventually my technical and creative curiosty led me to the realization that I would like to immerse more of myself into technology, becoming a better programmer and helping to bridge the gap between tech and non-tech environments. I'm driven to learning new things and better methods and it's exciting knowing that there's endless knowledge and opportunities to explore in the realm of web and software development.</p>

                <p>When I’m not programming you can find me reading graphic novels or sci-fy/fantasy books, hiking, playing music or trying to learn a new boardgame (usually to no avail). Please <a href="#contact">reach out</a> if you have any questions, would just like to chat, or have any projects you would like to team-up on. Cheers!</p>
