            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome! My name is Jason and I’m a web developer based in the greater-Seattle area. While relatively new to progamming, I’ve found immense satisfaction in it due to the never-ending challenges it presents and how rewarding it is to overcome those challenges and help solve problems that make life easier and more enjoyable for everybody.</p>

            <p>Most of my professional background has been in account management and client relations, and while I very much enjoyed the chance to work in those areas and hone my people skills, I often found myself working at the intersection where client service and technology meet and eventually my technical curiosty and drive for creative pursuits led me to decide that I would like to spend the rest of my days swimming the seas of technology, becoming a better programmer and helping bridge the gap between tech and non-tech environments. I have an insatiable hunger for learning new things and I know there will always be new and exciting things to learn in the realm of web and software development!</p>

            <p>When I’m not programming you can often find me reading graphic novels or sci-fy/fantasy books, hiking, playing music or boardgames. Please <a href="#contact">reach out</a> if you have any questions, would just like to chat, or have any projects you would like to team-up on. Cheers!</p>

                    <h3>Recipe Revelation</h3>
                    <p>This app is a reverse-recipe finder that allows you to find popular online recipes by searching for specific ingredients. It's for anybody that's ever wondered what meals can be made from the ingredients available in your kitchen, or just for uninspied chefs that want to find new recipes consisting of particular ingredients. The site is powered by Yummly.com's recipe APIs.</p>

                    <h3>Clash for the Cup</h3>
                    <p>This app allows you to create points-based golfing leagues for you and your friends and social groups. You can establish points for custom criteria and accomplishments achieved during each round played. The goal is to earn the most points during a season (for fellow golfers, think Fed-Ex Cup points on the PGA Tour) and have more incentive to continuously improve your game. </p>
